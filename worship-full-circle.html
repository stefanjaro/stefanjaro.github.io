        <p>In ancient times, objects, events, and beings guided our worship. </p>
<p><strong>Ancient Objects</strong> </p>
<p>There were ancestral carvings made of clay, stone or wood. </p>
<p>There were gigantic trees, mountains, and boulders whose presence and sight struck us in awe. </p>
<p>There were natural, seemingly otherworldly formations -- such as gems and crystals -- discovered in the earth or its cavities. </p>
<p>We worshipped these objects for they had some unexplainable effect on us. </p>
<p><strong>Ancient Events</strong> </p>
<p>If the forests were lit ablaze during a thunderstorm, it's because we had angered the thunder gods.  </p>
<p>If an earthquake destroyed our village, it was a punishment inflicted by the gods of the land.  </p>
<p>If rain did not fall and we could not quench our thirst, the water gods were testing our faith. </p>
<p>We felt powerless in the midst of these events, so we cried out to those that determined them. </p>
<p><strong>Ancient Beings</strong> </p>
<p>When the village shaman's concoctions cured our ailing children, she was gifted our most treasured possessions. </p>
<p>When the local soothsayer, by an absolute stroke of luck, predicted an eclipse, he was determined to be a supernatural being. </p>
<p>When a tribal leader was victorious in conquest over and over again, he was branded a god of war, and a king of kings. </p>
<p>The beings that successfully challenged the odds, for better or worse, were made worthy of our worship. </p>
<hr>
<p>And then came the beliefs in the unseen, the untouched, and the unexperienced. </p>
<p>The religions. The faiths. The philosophies. </p>
<p>These beliefs were compelling. They delighted those of us who believed in one and angered those of us that believed in another. </p>
<p>Wars were waged. Lives were lost. Voices were silenced and stories forgotten.  </p>
<p>Thus, only some beliefs remained. </p>
<hr>
<p>History repeats itself.  </p>
<p>Although we call ourselves believers of some faith, we spend most of our time, again guiding our worship through objects, events, and beings. </p>
<p><strong>Modern Objects</strong> </p>
<p>There are mansions that sit atop hills overlooking affluent neighbourhoods. </p>
<p>There are sleek vehicles with curves that rival a voluptuous female form. </p>
<p>There are mineral-infused devices that we carry in our pockets and call our second brain. </p>
<p>We worship these objects for they have some unexplainable effect on us. </p>
<p><strong>Modern Events</strong> </p>
<p>If the economy crashes and millions lose their jobs, it\'s because the very foundations of our systems were shaken too hard. </p>
<p>If the military rises in revolution and ousts our democratically appointed leaders, it\'s a message violently sent by an imperialist collective. </p>
<p>If famine breaks out in one country despite the abundance of food in another, it\'s a result of wilful ignorance and wilful inaction. </p>
<p>We feel powerless in the midst of these events, so we cry out to those that determine them. </p>
<p><strong>Modern Beings</strong> </p>
<p>When a business leader creates an offering to service a need we never knew we had, she is handed millions of our dollars. </p>
<p>When charismatic but incapable individuals arise to challenge qualified incumbents who cannot speak to the hearts of the people, they are awarded the highest positions of power. </p>
<p>When an individual offers people a spiritual or emotional respite from the monotony of the unending rat race, she is branded a philosopher. </p>
<p>The beings that successfully challenged the odds, for better or worse, were made worthy of our worship.</p>
